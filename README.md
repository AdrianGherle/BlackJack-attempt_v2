BlackJack-attempt_v2
====================

This is a simplified version of the original BlackJack card game. The game has only
one player and a dealer.
The player starts the game first by getting two cards from the deck. The player can
get more cards (Hit), or stand (Stand button). Dealer needs to get a minimum of 17
points unless the player is bust in which case dealer only takes two cards and wins.
To win, player needs to total more than the dealer without going over 21 (unles 
22 points are made from the first two cards). At the same total the dealer wins.

Card values:
1 (Ace) = 11 points or 1 point if total is over 21 from more than 2 cards
2  - 10 = value represented by the number
11 - 13 = 10 points (J, Q, K)
